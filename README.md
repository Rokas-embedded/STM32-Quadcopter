# STM32-Quadcopter

A quadcopter that I am slowly building. 

TODO after test 1:
* X Take off testing equipment as drone is too heavy to fly.
* X Uncomment second axis stabilization

TODO after test 2:
* X fix stuttering issue with motors. I think it is from receiving too little radio signals
* X figure out how to make screw nuts not undo themselves. Make the whole thing more rigid.
* X maybe upgrade to the extended range radio sensor
* X Make the robot turn off if it gets to an angle of like 45 degrees as that is not helping it hover

TODO:
* X Fix issues with remote control restarting and roll joystick not making contact with pins.
* X Fix quadcopter event loop lag. Improve refresh rate of robot
* ! figure out how to use integral without super windup
* X remove comments from both controller and quadcopter.
* X add loop timing to controller to have constant refresh rate
